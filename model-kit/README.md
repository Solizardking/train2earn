# Solana AI Model Kit

The Solana AI Model Kit is the terminal-first training surface for Clawd AI:
drop in PDFs, JSON/JSONL, CSV/parquet, notebooks, markdown, YAML, or image
context; build a public-safe SFT dataset; optionally train LoRA adapters; stage
Hugging Face and Ollama releases; and register the model with CAAP/1.0 at
`onchain.x402.wtf`. The site also includes a live model arena for running chat
or code-generation benchmarks across OpenAI-compatible providers, Anthropic,
Gemini, and custom endpoints, with realtime results and X share links.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /Users/8bit/Downloads/solana-clawd
python3 -m venv ai-training/.venv
source ai-training/.venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r ai-training/requirements.txt

ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit doctor
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit init
```

Drop files into `ai-training/data/incoming/`, then run:

```bash
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit one-shot \
  ai-training/data/incoming \
  --output-prefix data/model_kit/my-run \
  --dataset-repo solanaclawd/my-solana-dataset \
  --dataset-name "My Solana Dataset" \
  --train-dry-run
```

Open the frontend console:

```bash
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit ui
```

The deployable static app is also available at:

```text
ai-training/model-kit/frontend/index.html
ai-training/model-kit/frontend/register.html
```

Render/Vercel deployment is documented in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Model Arena

The homepage at `models.x402.wtf` starts with a model arena. It can compare any
provider with an OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint, plus built-in
adapters for Anthropic and Gemini. Provider keys can be supplied per run in the
browser form or via backend environment variables such as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
Keys are not written into run records.

OpenRouter is the primary multi-model lane. Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` on the API
server, then choose one of the `OPENROUTER_*` presets from the arena model-id
field. `/api/arena/providers` exposes each preset as `{ env, label, model }`,
and `render.yaml` carries the deployment defaults. Repeated shell variable names
follow normal environment semantics: the final value is canonical, with older
meanings kept under explicit aliases such as `OPENROUTER_CHATGPT_LATEST`,
`OPENROUTER_MODEL6`, `OPENROUTER_RIVER_FLOW`, and `OPENROUTER_FREE_MODEL1`.

Primary OpenRouter defaults:

| Env | Default model |
| --- | --- |
| `OPENROUTER_DEFAULT_FREE_MODEL` | `nvidia/llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2:free` |
| `OPENROUTER_FUSION` | `openrouter/fusion` |
| `OPENROUTER_KIMI_MODEL` | `moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code` |
| `OPENROUTER_CLAWD_DEFAULT_MODEL` | `anthropic/claude-opus-4.8-fast` |
| `OPENROUTER_GPT` | `openai/gpt-5.2` |
| `OPENROUTER_GROK43` | `x-ai/grok-4.3` |
| `OPENROUTER_CODEX` | `openai/gpt-5.1-codex-max` |
| `OPENROUTER_NVIDIA_MODEL` | `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b` |
| `OPENROUTER_QWEN_MODEL` | `qwen/qwen3.7-plus` |
| `OPENROUTER_DEEP` | `deepseek/deepseek-v3.2` |

Arena API:

| Endpoint | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/arena/providers` | Provider templates, adapter metadata, and code execution policy. |
| `POST /api/arena/runs` | Start a chat or code arena run. |
| `GET /api/arena/runs/{id}/events` | Server-sent realtime run events. |
| `GET /api/arena/runs/{id}` | Fetch recorded outputs and benchmarks. |
| `GET /api/arena/runs/{id}/share` | Build a shareable X intent URL. |

Code mode asks each model for Python, extracts the fenced code block, and runs it
with a timeout, temporary working directory, isolated Python flags, basic
resource limits, and a denylist for filesystem/network/process imports. Set
`MODEL_ARENA_ENABLE_CODE_EXECUTION=0` to disable server-side execution.

Completed runs are held in memory for realtime reads and appended to
`MODEL_ARENA_LOG_PATH` as JSONL, defaulting to `/tmp/model-arena-runs.jsonl`.
The API rehydrates completed runs from that log for `/api/arena/runs/{id}` and
shared `?arenaRun=` links; use a mounted path for long-lived production records.

## What It Builds

```text
source files
  -> document parser and secret filter
  -> chat-message SFT JSONL
  -> parquet train/eval/test splits
  -> dataset card and manifest
  -> optional LoRA / QLoRA adapter
  -> optional HF upload
  -> optional Ollama build
  -> optional CAAP registry payload
```

Side effects are gated:

- Local audit, ingest, and dry-run registration are safe by default.
- Hugging Face upload requires `--yes`.
- Remote Hugging Face Jobs require `--yes`.
- Ollama push requires `--yes`.
- Live `onchain.x402.wtf` registry POST requires `--yes`.
- Onchain Solana transactions require `--onchain --live --yes`.

| Images | Writes metadata rows; sidecar captions become SFT rows. |

Image sidecars:

```text
chart.png
chart.png.caption.txt
```

Raw image bytes are never written to JSONL rows, cards, manifests, or Hub
uploads.

  --flavor a100-large \
  --timeout 4h \

  --eval-accuracy 0.72 \
  --live \
  --yes
```

## NVIDIA Blueprint Lanes

| Blueprint | Local adapter |
| --- | --- |
| Transaction foundation model | `nvidia/blueprints/transaction-foundation-model/` |
| Model distillation | `nvidia/blueprints/model-distillation/` |
| Enterprise RAG | `nvidia/blueprints/enterprise-rag/` |
| Quantitative signal discovery | `nvidia/blueprints/signal-discovery/` |
| Portfolio optimization | `nvidia/blueprints/portfolio-optimization/` and `nvidia/cufolio/` |
| AI-Q | `nvidia/blueprints/aiq/` |

```bash
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit nvidia verify --strict
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit nvidia strategies
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit nvidia aiq --strict
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit train --lane tx-foundation --train-dry-run
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit nvidia tx-preflight --strict
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit train --lane tx-foundation --remote --yes
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit nvidia tx-foundation --strict
```

For remote transaction jobs, a `402 Payment Required` response means the
authenticated Hugging Face account needs Jobs credits. After launch, watch with:

```bash
cd ai-training
bash scripts/watch_transaction_foundation_hf_job.sh <JOB_ID>
```

## Perps Tool Lane

The model kit bakes in the source perps tools from `ai-training/perps/`:
`functions.py`, `functioncall.py`, `nvidia_perps.py`, `prompter.py`, `schema.py`,
and `README.md`. Generated `__pycache__/` files are ignored.

```bash
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit perps tools
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit perps tools --write --json
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit perps handoff --market SOL --mode observer
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit perps agent \
  --query "Assess the risk of long SOL-PERP 500 USDC at 2x"
```

Perps commands stay observer/paper-first. If `LIVE_TRADING=true` is present in
the environment, the model-kit wrapper refuses perps agent/handoff execution
unless `--allow-live-env --yes` is explicitly supplied.

## Unsloth And Ollama

The default training path is `scripts/train_lora.py` with Transformers, PEFT,
TRL, and Hugging Face Jobs. Unsloth is optional for local accelerated LoRA,
QLoRA, Studio workflows, and GGUF export.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://unsloth.ai/install.sh | sh
unsloth studio -H 0.0.0.0 -p 8888
```

Ollama preview/fine-tuned publishing uses the existing Ollama scripts:

```bash
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit ollama --mode preview --target core-ai --yes
```

## Security Contract

Never put these in files that can be committed or uploaded:

- `HF_TOKEN`
- `WANDB_API_KEY`
- `NVIDIA_API_KEY`
- private RPC keys
- OAuth client secrets or Google ADC JSON
- Solana keypairs, seed phrases, private keys, wallet passwords
- browser cookies or session dumps

Before public release:

```bash
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit constitution --strict
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit verify
python3 ai-training/scripts/verify_core_ai_release.py
python3 ai-training/scripts/verify_trading_factory_release.py --local-only --strict
```

For the full trading-factory release gate:

```bash
ai-training/model-kit/bin/clawd-model-kit verify --full-release
```

Model outputs must never be accepted as transactions. Execution code must parse,
validate, simulate, and risk-check every action first. Live trading remains
outside this model-kit automation.

The model kit treats `CONSTITUTION.md` as the interpretive authority and
`three-laws.md` as the immutable on-chain execution law set. Ingest, prepare,
train, upload, register, and one-shot workflows fail before side effects if the
required Constitution files are missing or if `CLAWD_THREE_LAWS_SHA256` is set
and does not match the local `three-laws.md` hash.
